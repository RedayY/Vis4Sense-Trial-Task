# Vis4Sense-Trial-Task

The trial task is to create test cases using Mocha/Chai for the bugs of not correctly creating the links in the history map when user opens a link (more than one type of bugs):

This does not always happen;
When it happens, sometimes there should be a link but it is not there;
Sometimes there should NOT be a link but there is one;
Try to cover as many types of errors as you can;
Bonus point: fix the bugs you found.

Approach: 

- Identify Learn and understand given code.
- Create test functions for smaller bits and go on further with bigger chunks
- Run in circles till I come up with a solution :)
