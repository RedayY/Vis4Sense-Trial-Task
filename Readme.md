SenseMap
========

Chrome extension to supporting sensemaking through analytic provenance. SENSEMAP stands for SENSEMaking with Analytic Provenance. Have a look of this paper if you want to find out more about 'analytic provenance': https://kaixu.me/2015/03/16/analytic-provenance-for-sensemaking-a-research-agenda-cga-2015/


The trial task
==============

The trial task is to create test cases using Jasmine or Mocha/Chai for the bugs of not correctly creating the links in the history map when user opens a link (more than one type of bugs):

This does not always happen;
When it happens, sometimes there should be a link but it is not there;
Sometimes there should NOT be a link but there is one;
Try to cover as many types of errors as you can;
Bonus point: fix the bugs you found.
Update: you can also use Jasmine as the testing framework. A free course on JavaScript testing using Jasmine and more information about using it with Chrome extension.

Approach:
========

>Identify Bug
>Understand Code;
>Create Testing Enviroment;
>Create Test Cases;
>Run in circles till I come up with something;
>Fix Bug;
